          I'm currently a fourth-year student at SFSU majoring in Computer Science.
          Throughout this project I'm looking forward to learning about what it's like to
          build a battle-tested webapp as a team. Aside from programming, some of my hobbies
          include: rock climbing, foreign languages, reading and video games. I've lived in
          California for my entire life but I'm originally from Sacramento and moved to the
          Bay Area when I started at SFSU. It's really exciting being able to learn about
          software development in the center in the most-prominent location for it around the
          world.
